***********************************************************
*VERY, VERY, VERY MUCH! UNDER DEEP DEVELOPMENT (8/10/2013)*
***********************************************************
Idiosyncratic Graphics Library for aesthetic and whimsical 
exploration of highly evocative and engaging forms, creatures 
and other virtually living/sentient entities.

The library explicitly trades efficiency, software engineering
principles and other development best practices for optimal
creative freedom and discovery based processes. That said, 
issues of craft in relation to creative coding practices
are considered as is overall stability and semantic
ergonomics. Confused? I certainly am.

Thanks to many super smart and more responsible people than me,
especially the Processing, openFrameworks and Cinder teams. 
Also thanks to the universities that have let me work on this 
stuff over the years instead of perhaps more redemable work: 
Miami University (Ohio), University of California Santa Barbara,
Southern Methodist University, University of Edinburgh. Most of
all thanks to Robin, Ian and Sophie.

If "any" of this seems at all interesting, please feel free to 
drop me a line at irajgreenberg at gmail dot com

Also, thanks for reading this!
